Layout: Our homepage features a logo at the top of the screen, followed by 3 sections that seperate the keyboards our retailer sells by category, Office, Gaming, and Professional. Each product we have available are displayed within their own product windows, and lists the name and price of the product. The product windows also hover when you mouse over a product in order to assist the user in identifying which product they will explore. Also, we have an About Us section at the bottom of the page.

When you click into any given product, you will be redirect to a product page that lists more information about the product, including more pictures that one can hover or click into. At the bottom of the page there is an Order Form for users to submit orders. Once filled and all fields are entered appropriately, the user can submit the form and this will prompt an email window to appear with all of the appropriate fields filled out.
